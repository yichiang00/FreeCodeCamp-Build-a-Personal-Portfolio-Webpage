            <p> I have a job as a sale associate in Sears. It is very crazy because I barly spoke English two years ago. I always remember that my friends were amazed when they knew I wanted to move and work in the United States.</p>
            <p>After I felt comfortable my English, I started to concentrate to pursue my REAL Career. Since I am always interested in computer, I decided to be a developer. I wish that I can tacle a lot of problems every day in my rest of life.</p>

            <h3>Joining Free Code Boot Camp And Epicodus</h3>
            <p> I feel happy every day when I come here. It is really great. It is very traditional style to listen lecture by learning new stuff for my country. However, I found that it saved much time and it brought a lot of fun by hands-on programming.<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-heart" aria-hidden="true"></span></p>
            <p>It is also cool that I can work with people every day. We can encourage each other to code. </p>
