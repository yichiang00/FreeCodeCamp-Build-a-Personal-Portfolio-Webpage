            <p> I feel happy every day when I come here. It is really great. It is very traditional style to listen lecture by learning new stuff for my country. However, I found that it saved much time and it brought a lot of fun by hands-on programming.<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-heart" aria-hidden="true"></span></p>
            <p>It is also cool that I can work with people every day. We can encourage each other to code. </p>
